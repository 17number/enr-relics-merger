  <section>
    <p>
      This page explains how this website (“the Site”) handles personal information,
      in particular the use of Google Analytics (“GA”).
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Use of Google Analytics</h2>
    <p>
      The Site uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google LLC,
      to understand how visitors use the Site and to improve our services.
      Information collected by GA is transmitted to and processed by Google on its servers.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      ※ The GA property currently used by the Site is <strong>G-BN1ZV55K0M</strong>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Types of Data Collected</h2>
    <p>
      GA typically collects information such as cookies, IP addresses,
      pages visited, time spent on pages, and referrer URLs.
      These data are aggregated and analyzed in a way that does not identify individual users.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. IP Address Handling</h2>
    <p>
      Google Analytics 4 (GA4) does not store full IP addresses; it includes built-in IP anonymization.
      If you are using Universal Analytics (legacy UA), additional configuration may be required to anonymize IP addresses.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Purpose of Data Use</h2>
    <p>
      The collected data are mainly used for the following purposes:<br>
      • Analyzing site usage (number of visits, popular pages, traffic sources)<br>
      • Improving the site’s functionality and user experience<br>
      • Detecting technical issues
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Data Sharing with Google</h2>
    <p>
      Data collected through GA are transmitted to Google and handled in accordance
      with Google’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

    <h2>6. Cookie Control and Opt-Out Options</h2>
    <p>
      Visitors can disable cookies in their browser settings to limit data collection by GA
      (note that some site features may not function properly if cookies are disabled).<br>
      Users may also install the “Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on”
      to prevent their browser from sending data to GA (supported browsers only).
